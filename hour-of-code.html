                        <p> On 6th of November, we, The Handlers, conducted Hour of Code event at Sumgait city
                            School No.1 to introduce children to the computer science world. We gathered children
                            from different schools and neighborhoods and decided to conduct Hour of Code event in
                            School No.1 as it was provided with necessary computer equipment. Our goal was to share
                            our knowledge with children to spark a light towards computer sciences, even it was a
                            small one.</p>

                            <p>Through the session, students not only engaged but also deeply
                                involved in solving loop challenges.
                                Familiarity with Minecraft and game
                                structure of the exercises caught their
                                attention and kept them motivated to
                                complete challenging tasks. Focus and
                                determination to solve tasks were signal
                                that showed interest and desire to learn
                                coding concepts.

                        <p>Overall, Hour of Code left students
                            excited and curious about the world of coding. Many participants shared that they have
                            liked the session, and they are interested in diving deeper into computer science. Their
                            positive feedback encouraged us to continue organizing events like this to expand coding
                            education. Based on the
                            feedback, there are ways to
                            make future events even better.</p>
